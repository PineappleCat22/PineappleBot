# PineappleBot

PineappleBot is a bot I made because I am really cool and also awesome

this thing is provided as-is!!!!!! just the code, no bot user. you can do that bit on your own, i believe in you!!!!!!!!!!!!!

lowkey? the html system kinda sucks. you gotta reload all the browser elements when the bot starts up, or at least make sure its running when OBS starts. whatever. imma use it.
